# sd_notify wrapper
This is one of the simplest fully working plugins in NVGT. It shows how to register a single function with NVGT using the plugin system, moreover, a function that is only available on one platform. On other platforms, the function is a no-op but the plugin will still compile. This allows angelscript code that uses the plugin to compile on one platform with the function registered while it runs on another.

In particular, this plugin wraps the sd_notify linux function which can be useful if you are writing a systemd service. On windows you can include the plugin and compile your game, this function will do nothing. On linux though, values will be sent to systemd as described in [the sd_notify man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sd_notify.3.html) when this function is called.
