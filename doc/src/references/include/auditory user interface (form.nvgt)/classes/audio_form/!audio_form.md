# audio_form
This class fecilitates the easy creation of user interfaces that convey their usage entirely through audio.

## Notes:
* All of the `audio_form::is_*` methods only work on certain types of controls, and will return false and set an error value if used on invalid types of controls. In other words, exceptions are not used here.
