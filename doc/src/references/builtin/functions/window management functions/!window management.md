# Window management functions
Windows are an extremely important part of any game. They're one of the most common things that shows on the user's screen, and also allow for keyboard/mouse input from the user.

## Notes:
* You can only have one NVGT window showing at a time.
* It is strongly advised to always put `wait(5);` in your main loops. This prevents your game from hogging the CPU, and also prevents weird bugs with the game window sometimes freezing etc.
